Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before you complete any booking with us as they set out your legal rights and obligations in relation to your booking. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, you must not make a booking with us.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

FlightAfter is a trading name of M G M TRAVEL AND TOURISM CO LLC LLC, which is registered at Sharjah and has its registered office at 125 , SF 20 Al Sayegh Building , Port Saeed , Deira ,

P.O.BOX 514424, DUBAI UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. (“we”, “us” or “our”). References to “you” and “your” in these terms means you and any other person in your party.

Your booking through us (either online or via telephone) is subject to: (i) these Terms and Conditions; (ii) the terms and conditions of the relevant Service Provider; (iii) where we are acting as a sub-agent of an agent appointed by the Service Provider, the terms and conditions of that agent; and (iv) where the Travel Service is booked on the Service Provider’s website, the website terms of use of the Service Provider.
</p>

<h2>Agency</h2>
<p>
We act as an agent for and sell various travel related products as agent on behalf of numerous transports, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, rail and cruise line operators as well as all of our wholesalers. Our obligation to you is to (and you expressly authorize us to) make travel bookings on your behalf and to arrange relevant contracts between you and travel service providers. We exercise care in the selection of reputable service providers, but we are not ourselves a provider of travel services and have no control over, or liability for, the services provided by third parties. All bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions including conditions of carriage and limitations of liability imposed by these service providers. We can provide you with copies of the relevant service provider terms and conditions on request. Your legal rights in connection with the provision of travel services are against the specific provider and except to the extent a problem is caused by fault on our part are not against us. Specifically, if for any reason (excluding fault on our part), any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which you have contracted your remedy lies against that provider and not against us.

<h2>Accuracy of Online Content</h2>
<p>

We take all practical steps possible to ensure that the details displayed on our website are accurate and up to date, but we do rely upon the information given to us by the Service Provider(s) which is intended to present a general idea of the services and facilities being offered. Sometimes – and particularly at the beginning and end of the season – certain facilities may be withdrawn for reasons such as maintenance, bad weather or lack of demand from guests or low occupancy.

Some advertised activities or facilities, for example watersports, may be seasonal and not available all year round. There may be local charges for some facilities, for example, TVs, safety deposit boxes, sun-loungers, parasols, spa access, tennis courts, pool tables and air-conditioning. Unless specifically confirmed in your room type or board basis, you must assume some, if not all facilities will be payable locally. If your Service Providers advise us about significant changes to descriptions or about the withdrawal of any significant facility, we will endeavor to pass this information to you.

The online content provided by our Service Providers may not include the latest safety precautions in place to manage the risks of COVID-19. Please refer to paragraph 1A above for more information as to what you should expect in this regard.

Transfer times quoted by the Service Provider for travel between airport and resort are approximate and, depending on circumstances, the journey time to your own chosen destination may be longer.

If you have booked a shuttle transfer, please note that these run to a set timetable and set route that may not always be immediately to your accommodation.

</p>

<h2>Package holidays</h2>

Some of the arrangements that we help you organize amount to "Packages", as this term is defined. In general, a Package will exist if you book a combination of at least two of the following Travel Services in a single booking with us, where the arrangement covers a period of more than 24 hours or includes overnight accommodation: (a) transport; (b) accommodation; (c) hire of motor vehicles; or (d) other tourist services.

When you book a Package, we will still be acting as an agent or sub-agent in the way described above and you will still be entering into separate contracts with the Service Provider(s) of each individual Travel Service.

As we help you organize the Package, the Package Travel Regulations require us to assist you in certain situations, which we will do as described in these Terms and Conditions.

1. Booking and Payment

By making a booking with us, you agree that:

A. all passenger details on the booking are full and accurate (please ensure that names are exactly as stated in the relevant passport).

B. you have read all the terms and conditions set out on this webpage and agree (on behalf of yourself and all other persons named on the booking) to be bound by them and any applicable Service Provider's booking conditions and website terms of use.

C. you have read our Privacy Policy and confirm that you will share our Privacy Policy with each named person on the booking; and

D. when making a booking, you are 18 years of age or over, and where placing an order for services with age restrictions, you declare that you and members of your party are of the appropriate age of purchase for those services.

Confirmation of your chosen Travel Service(s) will be conditional on you making such initial payment as is agreed by us on behalf of the Service Provider, or payment in full, including applicable fees and charges. Your booking is confirmed and contracts between: (i) you and us; (ii) you and the Service

</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>
In relation to such bookings, you appoint us to source and where relevant book those flights as your agent on your behalf and you are our principal. We will arrange for you to enter into the following contract directly with the airline concerned: (i) where the flight is booked by us on the airline’s website and not by one of our third party suppliers, you agree to be bound by the website terms of use when we enter the airline’s website in response to your search request or request to book; and (ii) you will be bound by the airline's terms and conditions upon your receipt of the Booking Confirmation.

You are advised to read these carefully prior to requesting us to book your flight. , we accept no liability in relation to any contract you enter into with the airline, or their acts or omissions, or for the flight service itself.

In the case of some airlines, we will use the payment information provided by you to book the flight seats you require on your behalf, and you agree that we can use the payment details you provide to do so. Where this is the case, you will see two separate transactions on your card statement: one will be for the cost of your flights with the applicable airline and the remainder will be your payment to FlightAfter in respect of your booking.

The airline may provide a booking confirmation directly to you by email and, in such cases, we will generally be unable to access or alter your booking. As such, any amendments to your booking must be made by you, directly with them, except where we state to the contrary in your booking confirmation or in these Terms and Conditions. We will issue a confirmation invoice that details our charges for the use of this booking service (if any).

Where we are able to access your booking with the airline, we may manage that booking on your behalf, including by accessing your account with the airline to administer the booking (e.g. by making amendments or requesting refunds or other options in relation to cancelled flights), or otherwise to monitor the booking with the airline.

The airline may send correspondence from time to time. We shall inform you of any important matters of which we are made aware that relate to your booking (for instance, schedule changes) and how this might impact upon other holiday arrangements booked with us. However, we will not pass on correspondence that does not relate to your booking. Where applicable, monies paid to us for such flight services are held by us on your behalf until they are paid to the airline in question.

Please note that payment by you to us does not constitute payment to the airline until we make that payment on your behalf, but if we collect monies from the airline on your behalf, their liability to pay that money to you is discharged.

Carriers publish baggage allowances applicable for carriage over their own services. Allowances include cabin baggage and check in baggage. These allowances tend to be based on a weight allowance or a piece system. We recommend you check your baggage allowance carefully, as you may incur a charge for the carriage of baggage in excess of their free baggage allowance. Carriers also publish baggage safety notices, which detail items that cannot be carried or can only be carried in checked baggage. Again, we recommend you ask your chosen carrier about the applicable baggage safety requirements.

Please liaise with your consultant regarding any special requirements you may have for your travel arrangements such as special meal and seating requests, room type or disabled access.

When booking with one of our consultants, please let them know your frequent flyer membership details (or other applicable loyalty program details) for inclusion in your booking.

<h2>Our Change and Cancellation Fees</h2>

<p>

The following fees apply if we change or cancel any bookings (including online bookings and bookings made with a consultant) at your request:

Changes to Domestic/International bookings will incur a fee per passenger per booking as specified in your service agreement in addition to supplier fees.

Cancellations to Domestic/International bookings will incur a fee per passenger per booking as specified in your service agreement in addition to supplier fees.

Cancellations to International bookings (excluding Trans-Tasman bookings) will incur a fee per passenger per booking as specified in your service agreement in addition to supplier fees.

If you wish to change or cancel flights booked online, you may contact us .

Cancelled bookings may also incur supplier fees, which can be up to 100% of the cost of the booking, regardless of whether travel has commenced. Supplier fees may also apply where a booking is changed and when tickets or documents are re-issued. Where we incur any liability for a supplier cancellation fee for any booking which you change or cancel, you agree to indemnify us for that fee. Where you seek a refund for a cancelled booking for which payment has been made to the supplier, we will not provide a refund to you until we receive the refund from that supplier.

</p>

<section>
<h2>Complaints</h2>

<p>
If you are in difficulty or wish to make a complaint whilst on holiday, this must be reported to us and the Service Provider or their local representative without undue delay. You must, as a strict condition of your booking, obtain a written record of your complaint from the Service Provider or their representative at the time the issue arose. If you are unable to speak to the Service Provider or their representative whilst on holiday, you should contact us.

If you fail to follow this reasonable procedure, there will be less opportunity for us or the Service Provider to investigate and rectify your complaint. Any compensation you may be entitled to could be reduced or extinguished as a consequence.

We will manage the complaint process on your behalf aiming to provide you a full response within 28 days.

Travel Advice: visa, passport and health requirements

The 6-month passport rule states that your passport must be valid for another six months before you depart for international travel.

However, not all countries follow the six-month requirement; some countries require that you have a passport with a three-month duration period. This requirement changes based on where you are traveling and sometimes even based on your nationality.

General information on visa, passport and health Requirements may change and you are therefore strongly recommended to check the up-to-date position with the Service Provider(s) of the Travel Service(s), Passport Office, appropriate embassy or consulate or your doctor as applicable prior to booking and in good time before departure.

Please ensure that all your travel, passport, visa and insurance documents and other documents required for travel, are in order and that you arrive in plenty of time for checking in at the airport. Please note that requirements can change at any time and at short notice. You agree that it is your own responsibility to ensure that you have all the necessary documents to travel and acknowledge that FlightAfter has no responsibility for this.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>

All prices are subject to availability and can be withdrawn or varied without notice. The price is only guaranteed when paid in full. Please note that prices quoted are subject to change. Price changes may occur by reason of matters outside our control which increase the cost of the product or service. Such factors include adverse currency fluctuations, fuel surcharges, taxes and airfare increases. Please contact your consultant for up-to-date prices.

</p>
</section>
<section>

<h2>Taxes</h2>

<p>

Airline, Hotel, Cruise, Tours ETC taxes are subject to change and are confirmed at the time your airline ticket is issued. There may also be a local tax charged at some airports.

</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Liability</h2>
<p>

To the extent permitted by law, we do not accept any liability in contract, tort or otherwise for any injury, damage, loss (including consequential loss), delay, additional expense or inconvenience caused directly or indirectly by the acts, omissions or default, whether negligent or otherwise, of third party providers over whom we have no direct control, force majeure or any other event which is beyond our control which is not preventable by reasonable diligence on our part. Our liability will also be limited to the extent that any relevant international conventions, for example, the Montreal Convention in respect of travel by air, the Athens Convention in respect of travel by sea, the Berne Convention in respect of travel by rail and the Paris Convention in respect of the provision of accommodation, limit the amount of compensation which can be claimed for death, injury, or delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage. Under circumstances where our liability cannot be excluded and where liability may be lawfully limited, such liability is limited to the remedies required of us under applicable law.

</p>
</section>
<h2>Payments</h2>

<section>
<h2>Credit Card

<p>

You authorize us to charge all fees incurred by you in relation to the services provided to the credit card designated by you. If payment is not received from the card issuer or its agents for any reason, you agree to pay us all amounts due immediately on demand. You indemnify us against any loss that may be experienced by us due to any fraudulent use or otherwise of that credit card.

We accept payment by all major cards. Cards are accepted subject to security and fraud checks, and we reserve the right to reject/cancel your Travel Service(s) should your booking request fail any element of these checks.

<section>
<h2>Bank Transfer</h2>

Please note that cheque payments require about 3 business days to process. If you are paying by this method, you will need to make the payment at least 3 business days prior to the actual due date.

<section>
<h2>Cheque</h2>
<p>

Please note that cheque payments require about 5 business days to process. If you are paying by this method, you will need to make the payment at least 5 business days prior to the actual due date. You agree not to stop payment of the cheque even when you cancel a booking. You agree that we may apply the proceeds of the cheque to satisfy any liability you have to us, including any liability in respect of cancellation fees, before refunding the balance to you.
